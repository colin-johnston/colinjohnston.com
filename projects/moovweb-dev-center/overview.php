              <p>Moovweb is an Enterprise software solution for delivering customized mobile experiences from a single codebase. The <a href="http://developer.moovweb.com" target="_blank">Moovweb Developer Center</a> is the primary hub for software downloads, documentation, and tutorials for developers using the Moovweb platform.</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
              <p>When Moovweb hired me to redesign the Control Center, one of the goals was to simplify the user experience by focusing on providing a streamlined interface for managing Moovweb projects in the cloud. This required moving the onboarding guides and all the developer-related content to a separate site that didn't exist yet. 
              </p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
              <p>I collaborated with product management on content development, devised a clear and logical information architecture, and produced many iterations of visual and interface design. I also worked closely with the Ruby on Rails developers to build a prototype of the app, and finally the production code that is present today. 
              </p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
              <p>The design and creation of the Developer Center allowed Moovweb to clearly separate the content <em>about</em> the platform tools from the tools themselves, and allowed product management to take advantage of the flexibility of a stand-alone property for delivering developer-oriented content in a more appropriate format.
