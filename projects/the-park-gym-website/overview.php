              <p>The Park Gym is a popular San Francisco gym that specializes in boxing and Taekwondo.</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
              <p>Owner David Park needed to update the gym's web presence to better communicate with existing members and attract new clients. He came to me with a variety of new content&mdash;such as videos and class schedules&mdash;and also needed to be able to post news items and easily update the site as new classes and offerings became available.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
              <p>Through an in-depth requirements analysis and content development process we determined the site needed both a new information architecture to better structure the site, as well as an updated visual design to better communicate the gym's brand.</p>

<p>Using a rapid prototyping approach I collaborated closely with David to develop new content and refresh the interface. I customized his existing WordPress theme framework to provide new functionality and allow for the development of e-Commerce integration with the gym's POS system.</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
              <p>The new site design captures the energy and dedication of David and his clientele, and the search-optimized content architecture has increased both organic search traffic and social media engagement overall.</p>
