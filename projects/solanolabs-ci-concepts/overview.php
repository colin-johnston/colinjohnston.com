              <p>Moovweb is an Enterprise software solution for delivering customized mobile experiences from a single codebase. The Moovweb Control Center is an application for managing Moovweb projects in the cloud. The primary tools are domain management, routing logic, security, and user management.</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
              <p>I was hired by Moovweb to create a user-friendly, visually coherent interface for a complex system of tools. The initial v4 build was top-to-bottom redesign of all interfaces as well as a rethinking of all content strategy for developer onboarding (this lead to the creation of the Developer Center). The v5 build was a complete rebuild of the platform with an array of powerful new features which required a rethinking of many interfaces, and provided an opportunity to enhance visual design and user experience on many areas of the system. 
              </p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
              <p>As the sole designer in the Engineering/Product Management group, I collaborated closely with product managers, front-end developers, and engineers to iterate on requirements, design deliverables, and prototypes, and provided a framework for user experience and interface design best practices. For the v5 redesign, after the adoption of Agile processes and integration of more user-centric practices, I contributed considerable product strategy while PM and Engineering staff contributed valuable ideas for better user experience design. The development of a complex, multilayered system required us to devise a complex, multilayered collaborative process.
              </p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
              <p>While the Control Center remains in continuous development, the foundation for consistent visual design, the well-structured information architecture, and the clear user flows and interfaces I built with the the Moovweb team helped the company provide better tools that sit at the core of their business.
              </p>
              <div class="panel radius"><p>One of the key accomplishments of the Moovweb 4 redesign was the creation of <?php echo $moovui ?>, a modular pattern library and styleguide built with Sass. This allowed us to quickly iterate on the styling of UI components and critical interaction patterns, as well as greatly increased the speed by which developers could integrate new features. It was initially included as a Git submodule on Moovweb v4, and has now been packaged as a Ruby Gem for Moovweb v5.</p></div>
