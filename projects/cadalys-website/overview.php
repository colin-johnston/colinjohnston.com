              <p>Cadalys is a leading Salesforce.com and Force.com consultancy. They build custom enterprise applications on the Force.com platform, and are the developers of Kred for CRM&trade;, the world's first social media influence app for Salesforce.</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
              <p>Cadalys came to me to update their web presence in advance of two major product launches. They required a responsive design to deliver quality user experience to mobile and tablet users, built on a search optimized CMS platform.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
              <p>Working with Cadalys' existing branding, I designed a consistent user-friendly interface for a custom WordPress framework that features easy-to-read typography, prominent content tags for products and services, and adaptive promotional elements that display appropriately on all devices.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
              <p>The new site successfully delivers marketing content in a consistent interface across all devices.
