                    <p>Paul Saffo is a forecaster and futurist. He explores the dynamics of large-scale, long-term change; he teaches forecasting at Stanford University, chairs the Future Studies and Forecasting track at Singularity University, and serves on the Board of the Long Now Foundation.</p>
                    <p>Paul has a rich collection of content—journal entries, essays, and interviews—and a well-known brand in Silicon Valley and internationally.</p>
                    <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
                    <p>Paul needed an updated brand identity and a complete refresh of his existing website. </p>
                    <p>For the redesign, the primary objective was to create a visual design that expressed the rational, intellectual clarity of Paul’s writing, as well as the inventive, human qualities of Paul himself.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the identity and visual design, my goal was to provide a straightforward user experience that worked well on all screens—from a tiny Android 2.3 browser to a high-resolution desktop screen.</p>
                    <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
                    <p>Working from Paul’s previous website I refined it’s more complex user interface down to it’s essentials, enhancing usability and setting the stage for a more focused and prominent identity. </p>
                    <p>One of the biggest improvements over the previous design is a much more simplified landing page; now, instead of quotations and an unclear path to the main content, the first screen users see shows the most recent journal entry and a featured essay from his archives.</p>
                    <p>I brought to the foreground graphical elements such as the unique navigation icons that had become a key part of his overall identity, and redrew them for hi-res displays. </p>
                    <p>Along with this I redesigned his logo, simplifying the typography and selecting a color with more presence—a rich deep red that communicates urgency without being too forceful.</p>
                    
                    <p>My design strategy for the interface design was to frame the entire site in the updated identity, which is anchored by the new logo, but supported by the icons and updated color scheme. Then, for each section, I frame the content with a large header agile that signals what is in that section. Some of these are very literal; others are ‘stories’ that become more clear once you acquire knowledge of Paul’s content.</p>
                    <p>Typography and color are core design elements of the new design. I selected two typefaces, one for headers and one for the body text. I chose Aller for the headings for it’s unique and inventive visual rhythm; I chose Acumin Pro for the body text for its high legibility and impression of rationality and clarity. The color palette is built around the logo color. The background (on desktop) is a cool dark gray, which optically recedes behind the main content area; the sidebar is a warm light gray, with a slight green hue to provide subtle contrast to the red of the logo and the icons.</p>
                    <p>I built the website as a completely custom theme for WordPress, using a blank Sage starter theme; by not using even a small portion of a UI framework such as Bootstrap, or any prebuilt templates, I was able to keep the code very lean, and keep the ’page weight’ down for slower networks (and it’s been so much easier to maintain!) </p>
                    
                    <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
                    <p>I created a website that presents a strong update to Paul’s identity, and frames his content with a graphical richness and elements of storytelling. It delivers a very pleasing and approachable user experience that’s highly performant and accessible across a wide array of devices.</p>
                    <p>Paul is extremely happy with the results.</p>
