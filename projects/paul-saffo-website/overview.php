              <p>Saffo.com is the journal of Paul Saffo, a renowned forecaster exploring the dynamics of large-scale, long-term change. </p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
              <p>Paul came to me to develop a replacement for his existing publishing platform, which was not flexible and scalable enough for his long-term needs. The primary challenge was to ad new content areas based on an existing interface and migrate all existing content with minimal downtime.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
              <p>Working closely with Paul to update the information architecture and document functional requirements, I developed a completely new site built on a custom WordPress framework that is now search optimized, cross-bowser compatible, and provides a considerable increase in load times.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
              <p>The new site seamlessly replaced the outdated site with near-zero downtime.
