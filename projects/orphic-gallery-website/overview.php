              <p>The Orphic Gallery exclusively exhibits art related to music. It is located in the artistic enclave of Roxbury, New York.</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_a; ?></h4>
              <p>The Orphic Gallery founder needed a website that would present exhibitions, artists, and gallery news in a clean and sophisticated way. The primary challenge was to design a user interface that was engaging yet did not interfere with a variety of art to be displayed.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_b; ?></h4>
              <p>Building upon my original identity system I designed an interface that welcomes the user to the site with a very clear navigation system and an uncluttered presentation of current exhibitions, and then presents more in-depth information about artists, the local arts community, and gallery news.
</p>
              <h4><?php echo $overview_section_c; ?></h4>
              <p>The site successfully presents the gallery's offerings and captures the atmosphere of the gallery itself.
