          <h3>Hadron - Responsive WordPress Theme Framework</h3>
          <p>Hadron is an advanced theme framework for building responsive WordPress themes. Currently I'm using stable components of Hadron on all website projects.</p>
          <p>Responsive web design (often abreviated to RWD) is an approach to web design which provides an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices&mdash;from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones. </p>
          <p>WordPress is a free and open source blogging tool and a dynamic content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.</p>
          <h3>Get What He Said - Relationship Advice iPhone App</h3>
          <p>GWHS is a powerful new app for iPhone where women can ask a question or answer a question about what a guy meant when he said something in the early dating process. I'm collaborating with two other talented people: a marketing and sales guru (who came up with this brilliant idea) and an interactive producer (who keeps the gears of the project running smoothly). My role on the team is creative director - responsible for all branding and user experience design. </p>
          <p>From the folks in the marketing department: "Women are busy, and dating can be confusing. Understanding where a guy is coming from can be maddening, especially on the first few dates. Sometimes women just want to know whether to stick with a guy or to move on. The Get What He Said app offers a women a unique new approach. Using the power of crowd-sourcing, the app helps answer that one all-important dating question: "What did he mean when he said". It's really that simple."</p>
