    I'm a Designer based in San Francisco, California.

    I help companies deliver quality products through research and design sprints, user-centered interaction design,
    rapid prototyping, and polished front-end design. I thrive on iterating with cross-functional teams to arrive at
    simple solutions to complex problems.
