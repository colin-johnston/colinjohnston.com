Intro: Solano CI is a continuous integration product for software development teams.

Overview:

## Overview

### Context

Solano Labs’ Solano CI is a platform for engineers that provides a critical function called continuous integration. Solano CI enables Agile software teams to break down large monolithic applications into smaller projects and services which can be rebuilt, tested, and deployed more frequently.

The Session View—the core of Solano CI—is a comprehensive real-time report of build progress and test results for a single software project. Since its initial release incremental changes to the system cause increasing usability and technical issues, the most critical being diminished trust in reporting accuracy.

### Problem

Engineering teams rely on continuous integration and testing tools to manage complex software development life-cycles. If these mission-critical tools introduce frictions or inaccuracies of any kind that result in delayed or broken software release, this can cause expensive missed go-to-market opportunities.

### Outcome

The new Session View increases the value and accuracy of the status report with a simplified, intuitive interface and a clear, precise data visualization. We increased user confidence in the system and overall trust in Solano CI.

Process:

## Discovery

### User Research

We studied customer feedback from support channels, and our team of engineers using Solano CI provided valuable insights.

I led customer interviews and contextual inquiries with key customers to better understand the challenges they faced.

### Technology Research

I facilitated internal research to audit how a wide variety of software languages and test suites performed across our entire backend platform. The goal was to look for patterns—success, failure, accuracy—to find a solution to the critical customer trust issue.

### Approach
My rationale was that if we radically simplify the session view to present only the most critical status and timing info, as well as ensure all data points are 100% accurate, we could improve both usability and customer trust.

## Ideation & Design

### Early Concept Sketches & Wireframes

Using research findings I set out to create a
new interaction model for the session view that prioritized ease-of-use and increased trust in the data presentation.

### Design Objectives for a Better Experience

Based on research and user analysis, I prioritized solutions to these problems:
- Impossible - to get a complete overview of build status
- Inconsistent views for different session types causes high cognitive load
- Poor discoverability of important data that leads to expensive errors
- Inaccurate or incomplete reporting data reduces overall trust in the system

## Prototype & Test

### Prototyping for User Testing

Through a process of moderated and unmoderated user testing we sought to reveal where we hit the mark with our solution, and where it might need improvement. I iterated on the designs multiple times informed by these user tests.

Proof-of-concept to gain alignment with stakeholders and get early feedback from key customers we had interviewed in the research phase]

### Real-world Testing

There was no practical way to deliver our initial prototype to customers using real-time data, so the engineering team built the new session view into the production app. We then allowed users to test it as an ‘alpha’ feature behind a feature flag.

Early-stage prototype with live data for user testing. This allowed us to validate complex system feedback design patterns that changed in real time]


## Final Design

### High-fidelity Mockups & Brand Alignment

The visual design was informed by my work-in- progress style guide and design system.

[TODO: original design image caption:** Session View – before: **
The original session view was hard to use and presented inconsistent and inaccurate data]

[TODO: new design caption: **Session View –after: **
The new session view design improved overall usability by showing the entire build and test session in an easy-to-scan timeline]
