One group of users wanted to see easily configurable reports of overall status, the other group wanted a way to quickly locate problem areas to solve problems more efficiently. For the initial version of the view, we decided to provide a basic tool that would solve both problems. We mapped out plans for a deeper dive into each use case for future versions.",

Introx:

Rollbarx is a real-time error alerting and debugging tool for software developers.

I led the design effort to create a new view in the web app that provides users visibility into errors across multiple Rollbar projects.
