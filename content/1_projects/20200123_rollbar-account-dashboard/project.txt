Intro: Rollbar is a real-time error alerting and debugging tool for software developers.

----

Overview:

## Overview 

### Context

The Account Dashboard is a new view in the Rollbar web app specifically designed to give engineers and managers a complete status overview of all active projects across their account instance.

### Problem

Rollbar customers have software projects composed of numerous applications and micro-services, each of which is accessed as a separate project. The lack of a comprehensive projects overview makes i much harder to mitigate potentially expensive failures. Zeroing in on important issues across multiple projects is inefficient, time-consuming, and costly.

Customers were becoming frustrated with this problem and switching to our competitors.

### Outcome

The project was a major win for Rollbar. Customer commitment to the product strengthened and attrition numbers decreased, especially among enterprise customers.

Process:

## Discovery

### In-depth User Research

I conducted numerous interviews with customers, specifically engineering team leads at larger organizations. When it was feasible, we went to customer offices and observed users directly in their workflows.

### Research-informed Design Decisions

Our research and testing revealed that customers typically had one of two distinct use cases: reporting or triage. One group of users wanted to see easily configurable reports of overall status, the other group wanted a way to quickly locate problem areas to solve issues more efficiently.

## Ideation

### Early Concepts & Sketches

From pencil sketches to pen-and-ink wireframes I generated over 100 ideas for various use cases. I encourage stakeholders at this early stage to keep an open mind when presented with a wide variety of concepts.

### Design Charettes

By bringing the Product team into the design process, we quickly connected product design and business strategy. Real-time group collaboration—when properly structured—yields better design decisions faster.

[TODO: insert whiteboard photo caption: **Collaborative design process:** I facilitated extensive brainstorming sessions to explore different features and use cases.]

## Design

### Connecting Research and Design

To serve both the reporting and triage use cases we designed an experience to:
- Provide a dedicated view showing all the projects in an account
- Present a clear visual representation of the health of selected projects
- Surface all filters available in the individual project view, making it easy for teams to drill down into issues across languages, environments, and error levels
  
(lazysrcset: ald-ixd_wireframe-v01.jpg link: ald-ixd_wireframe-v01.jpg linkclass: hb-single caption: **High-fidelity wireframes:** Taking outputs from ideation sessions, I produced all wireframes in grayscale to avoid distracting focus from structure and interaction.)

(lazysrcset: ald-ui_select-combobox-v01.jpg link: ald-ui_select-combobox-v01.jpg linkclass: hb-single caption:  **First version of the 'combobox':** Filtering controls are a key component in the new session view experience.)

(lazysrcset: ald-ui_select-combobox-v01-alt.jpg link: ald-ui_select-combobox-v01-alt.jpg linkclass: hb-single caption: **Evolving the ‘combobox’:** We opted for a control that shows selection count even when active because it's much easier to use.)

## Delivery

### Design Documentation for Developers

For this project, we relied mostly on existing component patterns that we had previously built into our design system. For new components, I created comprehensive annotated documentation to describe to front-end developers how the component should function.

[TODO: add combobox spec image caption: **Final ‘combobox’ design spec:**
Developers use these functionality specifications to construct the working component. In most cases, styles are included as subcomponents already built into the design system]
    
## Final Design

### A Simple Solution to a Complex Problem

The result was a simple yet powerful solution that aggregated project data onto a single view, making reporting and triage much easier. 

The positive impact on customer efficiency was immediate for early beta testers; what often took engineering teams hours now took as little as minutes, saving companies' money. 

[TODO: insert before image caption: **Before – repetitive overload:**
The Item View is rich in project data. But having to wade through many individual screens to find an issue is difficult]

[TODO: insert after image caption: **After – powerful simplicity:**
High-level actionable data from all active projects in one view save time]

### Customer Acclaim

“The Account Dashboard makes it dead simple to know where our engineering time has the highest leverage regarding issues affecting our customers and shoppers.” — Jason Kozemczak, Tech Lead at Instacart
