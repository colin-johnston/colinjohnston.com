Overview:

## Project Overview 

Website and identity design for forecaster Paul Saffo. 

### Context

Paul Saffo is a forecaster and futurist. He explores the dynamics of large-scale, long-term change; he teaches forecasting at Stanford University, chairs the Future Studies and Forecasting track at Singularity University, and serves on the board of the Long Now Foundation.

### Problem

Paul has a rich collection of content—journal entries, essays, and interviews—and is a well known brand in Silicon Valley and internationally.

Paul’s existing website was no longer providing his current or potential clients with an experience that would enable him to sustain and grow his business.

### Outcome

A refreshed visual and brand design that expresses the rational, intellectual clarity of Paul’s forecasting work and the inventiveness of Paul himself.

The new site delivers an improved user experience and makes Paul’s large collection of content accessible across a wide variety of devices; it has impressed many key clients and prospects, and helped him book a considerable number of new speaking engagements.

Process:

## Ideation

### Sketches

I created numerous sketches to find ways of simplifying a potentially complex interface down to its essentials.

For this project I was also particularly focused on setting the stage for a more integrated identity and prominent iconography.

## Visual Design

### Branding & Aesthetics

My visual design strategy was to frame the entire site in the updated brand, which is anchored by the new logo (which I previously redesigned) and supported by the icons and updated color scheme.

I framed the content in each section with a large header image that signals what is within it. Some of these headers are very literal; others are ‘stories’ that become clearer once you acquire more knowledge of Paul’s content.

(lazysrcset: saffo-styleboards.jpg link: saffo-styleboards.jpg linkclass: hb-single caption: **Style Boards:** I explored a variety of aesthetic choices to best communicate Paul’s brand identity. Typography and color are core design elements of the new design. - TODO: replace with individual images from deck)

(lazysrcset: saffo-art-direction.jpg link: saffo-art-direction.jpg linkclass: hb-single caption: **Photography:** I worked with Paul to produce original photography for certain sections. I experimented with treatments that would harmonize with the brand aesthetics.)

## Iconography

### Custom Icon System

Paul is known for his love of maps. I designed a set of icons that evokes navigation and wayfinding.

The icons serve functionally in the site navigation component, but also serve as a bridge to Paul’s brand identity—in the final desktop site I feature them prominently.

(lazysrcset: saffo-identity-icons-sketch.jpg link: saffo-identity-icons-sketch.jpg  linkclass: hb-single caption: **Hand-crafted symbols:** I drew each symbol in pencil to get a feel for its qualities before bringing the work in to my digital drawing tool.)

(lazysrcset: saffo-identity-icons-final.jpg link: saffo-identity-icons-final.jpg linkclass: hb-single caption: **Final icon designs:** Scalable vector graphics—SVGs—are crisp and clear on any device at any size.)

## Final Design

### Multi-device Mockups

With any adaptive experience, I design the desktop and mobile views side-by-side to ensure visual consistency.

[TODO: refactor images to present like in the deck]

### Heading TK [Launch? Delivery?]

[saffo.com – before
While the old site had a certain 1990s-era visual appeal, it was hard to use and was practically inaccessible on mobile]

[saffo.com – after
An accessible experience integrating enhanced branding, a strong aesthetic, and improved multi-device accessibility] [TODO: show hero image again? - need to show finished product vs old site]

<a class="link--to-top" href="#">TOP</a>

[TODO: decide if I want to talk at all about the dev part of the project. What is value of adding that?]
